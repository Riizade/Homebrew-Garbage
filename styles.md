Styles
=====
Rogue
-----
**Sneak** - When the character is able to act while the target of their action is unaware of their presence (either in combat or out of combat), they get two ability points to spend on a single action taken immediately. The points disappear if no action is taken, or if an action is performed but it was not an ability that required ability points.\
**Cheat** - When the character is able to pickpocket a character or use sleight of hand to alter something in their environment to their benefit, instead of gaining a circumstance bonus on a relevant roll, they may instead gain a ability point that may be used as long as they remain in circumstances where their alteration is useful. For instance, the character may pickpocket the mayor of a town while talking to them. The result of the pickpocket (which item might have been stolen, or even placed onto the mayor's person) does not need to be determined. Instead, the idea that they've done *something* beneficial for the party is understood, and the character gains a ability point.

Barbarian
-----
**Rage** - Any time the Barbarian could become angry, they may choose to do so and gain one ability point. They may additionally gain one point any time they are the target of an attack during combat. All ability points are depleted when the character exits combat or if they are no longer angry.

Scholar
-----
**Focus** - The character gains 8+(current_level) ability points any time their character gets a good night's sleep. They cannot exceed 8+(current_level) ability points in this way at any time.

Tactician
-----
**Preparation** - Any time the character has one hour or more where they can perform activity uninterrupted, they may gain 3 ability points. The character cannot exceed 3 ability points at any time.

Hoarder
-----
**Resourceful** - Any time the character would replenish their inventory points, they instead gain twice that amount. They may use their inventory points as if they were ability points.

Faithful
-----
**Devotion** - Any time the character performs an action that would be actively encouraged by their patron deity, they may gain one ability point.

Soul Collector
-----
**Harvest Souls** - Any time a living creature dies within long range of the character, they may gain a ability point. If the creature was of human intelligence or greater, they may instead gain 2 ability points.

Diplomat
-----
**Charismatic** - Any time a character improves their attitude toward you, you may gain 2 ability points. For example, you might do a favor for a townsperson, give a bartender information on rumors they find interesting, or just share a pint of beer with a random tavern patron.
**Well-Connected** - Any time you meet a new creature of humanoid intelligence or higher who is friendly toward you, you may gain 1 ability point.
