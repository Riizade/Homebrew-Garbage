Abilities
=====

Abilities have four major parts. The conditions that must be present for their activation, a difficulty roll that must succeed for the ability to take effect, the cost to use the ability, and the ability's description and effect. The conditions, difficulty, or cost may be omitted, but every ability must have a description or effect.

Many abilities have a section listed "Alternate Flavors". This section is used to list names of similar abilities that will help better align the ability's effects with the fantasy of a particular character, or give a player or GM ideas for slight variations on the ability that they can use instead.
