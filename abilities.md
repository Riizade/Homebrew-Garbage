Abilities
=====

Abilities have two parts: a cost and an effect. The cost represents the cost in ability points the character must expend to use the ability, and the effect is a description of what happens when the skill is used.

Many abilities have a section listed "Alternate Flavors". This section is used to list names of similar abilities that will help better align the ability's effects with the fantasy of a particular character, or give a player or GM ideas for slight variations on the ability that they can use instead.
