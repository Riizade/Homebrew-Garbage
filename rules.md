Quick Six
=====
A rules-light tabletop RPG designed to be described in under a page, and incredibly easy to expand upon.

Based on Open Six/Mini Six ruleset

Philosophy
=====
Flexibility
-----
Every rule contained within this system is optional. The GM has the final word on how the game functions and on the consequences of the players' actions. This ruleset is meant to provide suggestions on how a GM might like to structure the foundation of their game.

Applicability
-----
This system is designed to be used with any type of campaign setting, whether high-fantasy, modern military, sci-fi space cowboy, or eldritch occult. It's also designed to be able to accommodate specific, unusual settings easily due to the simple nature of extending the system with abilities relevant to your setting.

Expandability
-----
The core rules are designed to be simple enough and generic enough to implement aspects of any other game system into this framework. Many interesting parts of other systems, such as feats, spells, and powers from Dungeons and Dragons will fit into the general framework of "abilities" in this system. More broad traits and involved mechanics might be adapted into the "styles" framework in this system. GMs should feel comfortable writing homebrew abilities and styles due to the lightweight nature of the system.

Work in Progress
=====
Everything contained within this ruleset is a work-in-progress. Some sections contain multiple options for the rules governing particular interactions because the system is currently in development. Everything is subject to change, and all numbers are currently placeholders. This includes task difficulties, inventory points, level-up rewards, skill dice caps, etc.

Rolling Dice
=====
This system is a variant of the Open Six/Mini Six ruleset. That means that all dice in this system are 6-sided. Each attribute and skill has a number of dice associated with it. When you want to attempt a task and you are asked by the GM to make a roll, you total up the number of dice from your relevant attribute and a relevant skill, roll that number of dice, and total up the result. For instance, if you attempt to pick a lock and your character has 3 dice in Dexterity, and 2 dice in *lockpicking* (represented as 3D and 2D, respectively), you would roll 3+2 six-sided dice. You'd roll 5 six-sided dice and total up the result, which in this instance can range from 5 to 30 (5 if you roll all 1s, 30 if you roll all 6s).

Characters
=====
Attributes
-----
Characters have 4 attributes
Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Charisma
When performing a task, roll the number of dice associated with the stat most closely related to the task. For example, coaxing information out of a townsperson would be related to Charisma. Breaking down a door would be Strength. Picking a lock would be Dexterity. Having offhand knowledge about the world would be Intelligence.

Attributes - Design
-----
I essentially started with the D&D model, and eliminated Wisdom, because often it can be difficult to distinguish a clear line between Wisdom and Intelligence. Really? Seeing things (perception) is a "Wisdom" skill? Additionally, Constitution is gone because it too often relates to physical strength. In an abstract, somewhat metaphorical sense, there is "strength" in withstanding a wound or shrugging off the effects of a poison in the same way that there is "strength" in bending iron. Both stats lend themselves to the same core experience of playing a character who is heroic in the manner of Beowulf and Hercules insofar as they are unrealistically athletic. If you want to play this type of character, you can prioritize the *Strength* attribute, instead of being forced to choose between *Strength* and *Constitution*. This choice is not present for mage-type characters (*Intelligence*), rogue-type characters (*Dexterity*), and Bard-type characters (*Charisma*), so it should be the same for beefy bruiser-type characters.

Skills
-----
Characters have any number of skills. Skills are more specific than stats, and add bonus dice when attempting an action related to the skill. Skills are subject to GM approval, as they can't be too generic. *Doing Things* is not an appropriate skill, because it applies to too many potential tasks.

An appropriate skill might be *Climbing*. Attempting to scale a cliff then would add together your dice from your base Strength skill (or optionally Dexterity, depending on which your GM deems appropriate) with your *Climbing* skill dice. With a Strength of 3D and a Climbing skill of 2D, you would roll a total of 5 dice to determine the result of your action.

Combining Skills
-----
Option 1) If you have multiple skills that might be relevant to a particular task, such as "Hunting Deer" and "Sharpshooting", only the highest of the relevant skills applies. If your character has skill in "Riding" and in "Archery", and is attempting to make a shot on horseback, both skills are applicable but apply in clearly different ways.


Option 2) You may use the highest of your relevant skills to make the roll, and then add +1 to the result of the roll for every die in the other applicable skill. For example, if a player has 3D in *Archery* and 2D in *Riding*, with a Dexterity attribute of 4D, they would use *Archery* + Dexterity and roll 7 dice (4D + 3D), then add +2 to the result for the 2 dice in their *Riding* skill.

Skills - Design
-----
This type of framework is used in many systems, and the primary reason I've chosen it here is so that we make no assumptions about the setting in which this ruleset will be used. In a cyberpunk world, *Hacking* would likely be one of the most important skills one can have, but it's clearly not appropriate for a medieval fantasy setting. Attempting to genericize these skills into something like *Bypassing Security* which represents lockpicking and hacking together, depending on the setting, is just awkward and will likely still fail to adequately represent the skills important to many settings.

Abilities
-----
Have any number of abilities. Abilities are things like casting a particular spell or going into a barbarian rage. Abilities may require any or all of three things to activate:
**Conditions**: An ability may require certain conditions to be met before it is possible to use the ability. This could include the condition that a character must be surrounded by enemies to activate an escape maneuver, or they must be angry about something specific before they can fly into a barbarian rage.
**Difficulty**: An ability may be difficult to use. This means it would involve a task at some difficulty level to activate. For example, casting a particular spell might be difficult and error-prone, and require a task with target difficulty 12 to activate.
**Cost**: An ability may have a cost for its use. For example, a character might have to rest for an hour after expending a large amount of effort. Perhaps they can use a very powerful attack, but after its use they suffer a 2 dice penalty to Strength for the rest of the session. The most common cost an ability might have is its cost in "ability points". ability points are points that characters can expend to activate more powerful abilities, but must be acquired by the players via various means related to their character's "style".

An ability could require none of these things at all. For example, a character might want to have the ability to radiate a soft light from their hands when exploring dark places. This doesn't require any specific conditions to be present, might be trivial to activate, and doesn't cost anything to the user.

Once an ability is activated, it takes effect. The effect should generally be more powerful if the conditions for using the skill are rare or difficult to meet, if the target difficulty of the ability is high, or if the cost is severe.

Abilities - Design
-----
Abilities are amorphous in the way they are in order to provide a framework that can accommodate spells, feats, skills, attacks, actions, and all manner of other entities from other game systems. Feats from D&D will often have conditions, but no difficulty or cost. For example, Darkvision could become "When it is dark, gain 2 dice in the *sight* skill". Spells from D&D might have a cost, but no difficulty or conditions. For example, casting Cure Wounds might become an ability with a cost of 1 ability point, causing the character to manage their usages much as they would as a spellcaster class in D&D.

Much of the interesting parts of a character will probably come from the abilities they have access to. This is often true for many players, and this system aims to solve a few problems present in D&D (and similar rulesets). One problem is that often spellcaster characters can just do more things than other characters can. They have a ton of tools at their disposal. If their charisma is garbage, they might have the "Charm" spell available. If their Strength score is low, they can just cast "Enlarge Person". Spellcaster characters are interesting to play, and that experience should be available to players, but it shouldn't come at the cost of trivializing their party members' contributions. With this ability system, the aim is that every player has access to the same number of "spells" (abilities), the abilities are just flavored according the character's background to maintain the fantasy of playing a character with particular strengths. Secondly, this system is an attempt to solve the "linear fighter, exponential mage" problem, where a Fighter character gets access to maybe 2, 3, 4 attacks in a single round as they become higher level, while a mage gets access to 9th level spells such as *Wish*, *Time Stop*, *Power Word Kill*, that outclass anything a Fighter will ever be able to accomplish. Often a fighter will start being able to use abilities with extra reach, say, one extra unit, but casters can access *Meteor Swarm* with a range of 1 mile. This system cannot completely limit this, as the fantasy experience for mages demands that they have abilities that break the laws of physics, while the fantasy experience for Fighters often just involves being unrealistically athletic and skilled in combat. However, I want to avoid codifying a specific "spellcasting" system into the game that lends itself to abuse in terms of the diversity and quantity of tools available to characters able to cast spells when compared to characters without the ability to cast spells.

Style
-----
A style describes how a character generates their ability points. For example, a "Barbarian Rage" style might give a character a ability point any time an "attack" (physical or verbal) is made against the player, which dissipate when the character is no longer angry as a result of this action. A "Scholar" or "Wizard" style might give a character 8 "focus" points that replenish when the character sleeps for a night. A "rogue" style might give the player 3 points to use any time they make an attack on an enemy that is unaware of their presence, or a single point any time they successfully use sleight of hand to steal or cheat.

Style - Design
-----
Style was added for a few reasons.

One is to allow characters ability points. Without ability points, it can often be difficult to find an appropriate cost for a powerful ability. Many players want the ability to give their character say, a teleport spell. It forces the player to recognize an opportunity cost. They might be able to use one powerful ability to overcome a difficult obstacle, but they might also see that they could use less powerful abilities in more creative ways several times instead. By using the powerful ability, they give up some usage of their lesser abilities. Without ability points, it's very difficult to give a meaningful cost to the ability that would prevent players from just warping around everywhere and trivializing many obstacles. It's important for players to have powerful tools at their disposal every so often, however, because it varies the pace of the game.

The second reason is to prevent characters from feeling too similar. Flavor is still very important. For example, a large warrior-type character might have a "Crush" ability that smashes things to dust, while the same ability could be represented on a rogue-type character with a "Sabotage" ability, or on a mage-type character with a "Deconstruct" or "Make Vanish" ability. The same mechanical abilities being available for characters of multiple types can cause them to feel indistinct. The "Style" mechanic helps characters feel different, even with the same abilities, because they earn their usage in different ways.

Another reason is to incentivize flavorful play. The player must take actions that are relevant to the core of their character in order to earn their usage of abilities. A "Barbarian Rage" character will always be looking for an excuse to enter a fight or become angry to earn their ability points, while a rogue will always be sneaking around and attempting to lie, cheat, and steal to earn theirs.

Creating a New Character
-----
Characters start with 12 dice to distribute among stats, 7 dice to distribute among skills, and two abilities.

Stats are limited to 4 dice at level 1, increasing by 1 every 5th level. Level 5 characters are limited to 5 dice per skill, level 10 to 6 dice, etc.

Skills are limited to 2 dice at level 1, increasing by 1 every 3rd level. Level 3 characters are limited to 3 dice per skill, level 6 to 4 dice, etc.

Leveling Up
-----
Levels are granted at GM discretion, but should be granted every time a small story arc concludes (every 1-3 sessions depending on the pace of the game).

Upon leveling up, the following happens:
Every level, characters get W
Every X levels, characters get 1 die to distribute to their stats.
Every Y levels, characters get 2 dice to distribute among their skills.
Every Z levels, characters get an extra ability.

Leveling Up - Design
-----
I have not though about this very much yet. The above section is essentially placeholder text.

Tasks
=====
Most challenges in the game can be represented as "tasks". Tasks represent your character attempting to overcome an obstacle by using their skills and attributes.

Task difficulties:
-----
2-5: Trivial.
Most people can do this without much effort, but might make a mistake with incredibly poor luck. These checks should only be made if they are critical to the session in some way.
Examples: driving at a comfortable pace, or searching a room for something you've misplaced.
6-10: Easy.
Untrained persons might have difficulty with these tasks, but they should be second-nature to skilled characters.
Examples: Hammering in a nail,
11-15: Moderate.
These tasks are consistently achievable only by persons trained in the task, but still carries a small risk of failure. Unlikely for an untrained person to consistently succeed at tasks of this difficulty.
16-20: Expert-level.
Tasks that require training to even have a small chance of success, and that can be challenging even for trained persons.
21-30: Mastery.
Requires mastery over a task to attempt this tier, it is very unlikely for anyone else to succeed.
31-35: Heroic.
These tasks are highly improbable for even masters to accomplish, and represent a large amount of both mastery and luck contributing to a success at a task of this magnitude.
35+: Legendary.
These tasks are almost impossible. Borderline unbelievable even when witnessed firsthand, and worthy of tales that will be told for generations.

Attempting a Task
-----
To attempt a task, players roll dice according to the relevant attribute (as determined by the GM), and make an argument for any skills they think might apply to the task. Once the appropriate attribute and skill(s) have been chosen, the player rolls all the dice they have available as a result.

Tasks in general can only be attempted once per party, not per character. For example, if a lock must be picked, the party should elect to have the character with the greatest dice pool for that particular task roll to attempt to pick the lock. Their success or failure represents the party's entire efforts.

Attempting a Task - Design
-----
Any skill check can become a minigame where the player makes their best argument to add a particular skill's dice to their roll, and the GM ultimately decides whether or not it makes sense. Many great moments can be had by applying a skill to an unexpected situation. It should be determined with care, however, just because a character is great at tying knots, doesn't mean they're "good with their hands" and can pick locks. A broad generalization like this causes even the most specific skills to end up essentially applying a flat dice bonus to an entire attribute.

Tasks can only be performed once per party to counteract the numbers effect. Playing the game with a party of two should feel similar to playing with a party of six. If an attempt can be made per character, even if only one character has skills relevant to a particular task, because of the variance of die rolls, more attempts increases the chance of success. In this way, a party of six will often succeed where a party of two would not, even if the party of two has characters with more relevant skills.

Combat
=====
Combat in this system is deadly. Enemies are felled in a single swipe, and you yourself can similarly be incapacitated in a single attack. This is to help speed up combat and to make the in-game combat feel much more hectic and unpredictable. Even the best warrior can be hit by a lucky attack and be rendered unable to fight.

Initiative
-----
Initiative is incredibly important when combat is resolved in a single strike. It's not uncommon for combat to be entirely resolved within a single turn! To determine initiative order for players, roll a Dexterity check and add any relevant skills, such as "Quick Reflexes", "Initiative", or "Preparing for the Unexpected". In the event that two players have an equal initiative, the party should decide among themselves which character will take their turn first.

Enemies have set numbers for their initiatives, and in the event of two enemies with an equal initiative score, they can be arranged in any order the GM desires.

Attacking
-----
When attacking an enemy, you must clear a task of their target difficulty with one of your combat skills. If you succeed, the enemy is incapacitated for the rest of the fight. As a rule of thumb, melee attacks are generally governed by Strength checks, ranged attacks by Dexterity checks, and magical or supernatural attacks by Intelligence checks.

Defending
-----
When an enemy attacks a player, the player again rolls for a relevant skill/attribute combination and attempts to clear the target difficulty of the enemy's strike. If they fail, the player is wounded and is unable to contribute to the rest of the fight. The attribute used to defend against attacks is slightly different than when attacking. Strength is still used to defend against melee attacks, and Dexterity for ranged, but if an enemy casts a spell, generally you'd dodge it as a ranged attack with Dexterity. Intelligence defenses are instead used for attacks that focus on dominating a player character's mind or attempting to use a curse on them that cannot be dodged.

Combat - Design
-----
These combat rules exist essentially to solve the time commitment problem with combat. Yes, combat is fun for many players, but it consumes a disproportionate amount of time in many systems. A few seconds of "in-character" time brawling might play out over several hours around a gaming table. To me, tabletop RPGs are about creating interesting stories. While combat can generate great narratives, and often great events that people will recount weeks later when talking to other tabletop RPG players, it just takes too long to do so. My favorite stories are from interactions between player characters and each other, or between player characters and memorable NPCs. Combat often detracts from that in that you make less of those moments per session if most of each session is devoted to swinging swords at each other.

Devoting so many rules and systems just to account for combat causes combat to become the primary method for players to overcome any obstacle. It is difficult to then make peaceful characters, such as a traveling pacifist priest who is scared by the sight of blood, or a hearty merchant who has wealth to spare but hasn't had a reason to sprint in many years. Playing an athletic, skilled adventurer appeals to many people, but having skill in combat is mandated in many rulesets in a way that other skills are not, causing it to be unenjoyable to create characters that cannot or will not fight. If you make a non-combat character in D&D, you'd be left out during those 4-hour combat sessions.

I understand that there is great appeal in detailed combat systems for many players. I argue that there are a great many systems to choose from if that is why you play tabletop RPGs, and that there will never be a reason to choose this one over a battle-tested system like D&D 5e or Pathfinder.

The one-hit mechanic does a few things. Primarily, it serves to speed up combat, which I see as a desirable goal for the reasons listed above. It also serves to make combat feel more deadly. It only takes one unlucky roll to take a player character out of combat. This should help to make combat feel exciting and dangerous, despite the lack of strong systems to support combat. The last thing I've considered is to make the element of surprise and preparedness feel meaningful. In many systems, getting the jump on your opponent is certainly helpful, but especially in longer fights, an overall minor advantage. The element of surprise is often the single most important thing you can have to ensure victory in combat in the real world (not that I have much personal experience, or that I'm an expert), and it is a nice minor touch to have this system reflect that reality. If everything is defeated in a single hit, it often only takes one round of combat to finish off your opponents. This makes a free first turn incredibly important.

As far as attacking and defending go, they put the power into players' hands. Players feel like they have control over their own destiny. If they get hit, it's because they rolled poorly, if they defeat an enemy, it's because they rolled well. It's often frustrating to "play well" tactically in D&D only to be downed because of a lucky crit from a nonthreatening enemy. This can still happen, but the frustration is lessened because rolling poorly feels less like it's out of the control of the player. This is essentially an aspect of combat I've ripped from Cypher System because I quite enjoyed it there.

Creating unique combat encounters in this system is certainly more difficult due to the limited tools available to GMs, but still possible. Hardy, defensive monsters will have a higher target difficulty to hit, rather than a higher health pool. Especially lethal or dangerous monsters will have a higher target difficulty for remaining standing after an attempted attack. Some opponents might not be particularly hardy or dangerous, but they might have a very high initiative score, and often get the entire first round of combat to themself.

The primary thing that this system loses is epic boss battles. I am considering writing rules modifications for boss battles specifically. For extra special fights, the boss might have an HP pool where each time they would die, they instead lose 1 HP. A reasonable value for a boss might be twice as much HP as there are players in the party for a lengthy, epic fight. An alternative system might be similar to Titan Souls, where some objective must be accomplished before the boss can be killed, but they still die in a single hit. For example, a necromancer might have multiple phylacteries around the room you must destroy. A mage might have a protective forcefield surrounding them until you destroy each of the crystals that power it. A swashbuckling swordsman might escape using the ropes that support the sails of his ship until you cut each of the ropes. In addition, boss creatures should have high target difficulties to hit, so that the final blow is recognized as a hard-won success for the party.

Death and Failure
=====
When a player fails a skill check or is incapacitated in combat, they should suffer some consequences as a result of their failure.

Failure
-----
For many tasks and skill checks, the consequences of failure are determined entirely on-the-fly by the GM. For example, if a player character fails to persuade a townsperson to tell them a closely guarded secret, the townsperson may refuse to interact with them further, or even begin to speak angrily of the players to other townsfolk, impacting the party's reputation in that region.

Wounding and Death
-----
For tasks that carry a large amount of danger to one's physical well-being, and for falling in combat, players may become wounded or even die as a result of their failure.
If a player would be wounded, they should roll a D6. On a 5 or 6, they suffer no ill effects. On a 2-4, they suffer a wound, which causes them to take a 1 die penalty to all checks until their wound heals. On a 1, the character dies.

Death is of course an optional rule. Not everyone wants their character to be at risk of death, many campaigns prefer to focus on one cast of characters over many sessions rather than an ever-changing roster of fragile adventurers.

Items and Equipment
=====

Mundane Items
-----
Mundane items are things that most people could procure given a month or so of time to gather materials, find and purchase the item, or craft the item from scratch. A character is assumed to have everything they need to complete their adventure. Rather than preparing in advance and managing an inventory dozens of lines long, each character may list a few (generally no more than 5) regular items they always carry with them. This list could include their weapons (such as a bow with quiver, alongside a shortsword), some tools of the trade (such as lockpicks or an alchemy kit), or sentimental items (such as a locket from an old lover).

For everything else, mundane items are governed by the usage of inventory points.

Inventory Points
-----
Each character has a number of inventory points determined by their level. When players want to have access to an item in the field, they must procure it, spending their inventory points to do so. Procuring something simple and common, such as a length of rope, might cost a single inventory point. If a player would like to use something that is difficult to obtain and would be unusual to bring along on a journey, such as a silver teapot, it may cost five or more inventory points to procure it on the spot.

Procuring an item using inventory points represents the character's foresight in bringing the item along. The item's existence applies retroactively, and the character is considered to have held this item since the last time their inventory points were replenished. Once a character procures an item using inventory points, they are also considered to have access to that item until the next time they replenish their inventory points to their maximum (unless as part of their usage of the item, it becomes inaccessible, such as if they gift it to an NPC, or if the player character eats a food item).

Some particularly common items may cost no inventory points to procure, such as a small coin or clothing the character would almost certainly be wearing even if not listed on their character's inventory.

Inventory Points - GM Notes
-----
The cost of an item should be determined not only by its rarity, but also by context. If the players attend a masquerade ball in a large city, they may have thought to keep a mask on them for just such an occasion, and it might cost a single inventory point to acquire. If the players instead stumble across a secret cult meeting deep underneath some ancient ruins, where each cultist is wearing a masquerade mask, to procure the same mask it may cost 3 or more points because it's unlikely the character would have anticipated a need for the mask.

Inventory Minutiae
-----
Eating, drinking, sleeping, and other basic maintenance responsibilities are not codified into rules in this system. If lack of food for or other basic necessity becomes a major plot point in your session (for example, because your players are undergoing an arduous journey through a barren wasteland), players should generally complete tasks with skill checks to remain unaffected by hunger and thirst, or to procure food from their surroundings.

Similarly, tracking ranged ammunition for weapons such as guns and bows is just not exciting. If a player wakes up to find much of their equipment stolen, perhaps the GM could rule that they are unable to use their bow until they are able to procure both the bow itself as well as arrows to use as ammunition, but in general play there is no reason to count how many arrows you're firing.

Interesting Items
-----
Sometimes the party picks up magic items, or items that are beyond the reach of most people. This includes things like a magic sword that can't harm its owner or its owner's allies, a scrying orb that allows you to view far away places, or even just an incredibly expensive set of mithril armor, these items should be explicitly listed on a player character's character sheet. They should also have clearly defined effects or bonuses. A magic sword might add 1 die to your swordfighting skill, for example. Mithril armor might add a die to any applicable Strength and Dexterity defense rolls. The scrying orb might not confer any mechanical bonuses, but allows players to do something they normally wouldn't be able to (such as look upon distant places or other realms through the scrying orb).

Interesting items with powerful or particularly useful effects might cost either inventory points or ability points to use.

Interesting Items - GM Notes
-----
Interesting items can often be easily created on the fly by selecting an ability that no party member currently has, and turning it into an item. Maybe the *Invisibility* ability could become a *Potion of Invisibility* with a single use, or a *Ring of Invisibility* that simply grants the wearer the *Invisibility* ability, but it might cost inventory points instead of ability points.

Inventory - Design
-----
The primary motivation for these inventory systems is to cut down on mental clutter. Often players will forget what their characters have access to in their inventories because it's a poorly maintained scribbled list many lines long on their character sheets. Picking up a plot-important key might be forgotten in the next session because its presence is buried within many lines of text that players seldom read. The idea of these systems is that if something is listed as being in your inventory, it's because it's important. Either important to your character and the fantasy that character represents, or important to the narrative or mechanics of the game. A quick glance should be all a player needs to determine what tools they have at their disposal. The points and rolls systems exist to allow players to utilize creative solutions with mundane items despite the lack of useful items listed on their character sheets.
