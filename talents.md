Talents
=====

Talents have two parts: a cost and an effect. The cost represents the cost in talent points the character must use to acquire the talent, and the effect is a description of the effects of the talent.

Many talents have a section listed "Alternate Flavors". This section is used to list names of similar talents that will help better align the talents's effects with the fantasy of a particular character, or give a player or GM ideas for slight variations on the talent that they can use instead.
