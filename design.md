Homebrew Garbage
=====
A rules-light tabletop RPG designed to be fast to play and incredibly easy to expand upon.

This document is meant to be used in conjunction with the rules document. This is the design document, which details some of the thoughts that went into decisions around the systems and rules of Homebrew Garbage.

Characters
=====

Attributes
-----
I essentially started with the D&D model, and eliminated Wisdom, because often it can be difficult to distinguish a clear line between Wisdom and Intelligence. Really? Seeing things (perception) is a "Wisdom" skill? Additionally, Constitution is gone because it too often relates to physical strength. In an abstract, somewhat metaphorical sense, there is "strength" in withstanding a wound or shrugging off the effects of a poison in the same way that there is "strength" in bending iron. Both stats lend themselves to the same core experience of playing a character who is heroic in the manner of Beowulf and Hercules insofar as they are unrealistically athletic. If you want to play this type of character, you can prioritize the *Strength* attribute, instead of being forced to choose between *Strength* and *Constitution*. This choice is not present for mage-type characters (*Intelligence*), rogue-type characters (*Dexterity*), and Bard-type characters (*Charisma*), so it should be the same for beefy bruiser-type characters.

Skills
-----
This type of framework is used in many systems, and the primary reason I've chosen it here is so that we make no assumptions about the setting in which this ruleset will be used. In a cyberpunk world, *Hacking* would likely be one of the most important skills one can have, but it's clearly not appropriate for a medieval fantasy setting. Attempting to genericize these skills into something like *Bypassing Security* which represents lockpicking and hacking together, depending on the setting, is just awkward and will likely still fail to adequately represent the skills important to many settings.

Abilities
-----
Abilities are oftentimes the most interesting part of a character. In the general case, abilities represent unique actions that your character can take in response to a given situation. Any character can attempt to break down a door (with varying degrees of success), but only *your* character can phase through the door to appear on the other side. There was a choice of how to limit abilities, or whether to limit them at all.

There are a few goals I wanted to accomplish with abilities:
- During character creation, incentivize players to choose "weaker" abilities on a per-use basis, because some of the most interesting gameplay happens due to creative use of the *Prestidigitation* spell, even though *Summon Fortress* is super badass.
- Provide a flavorful way to reward players for situational bonuses (and roleplaying)
- Ensure that players are making interesting choices with respect to which abilities they use in a given situation
- Allow for weaker characters to choose strong abilities with the tradeoff of a "One Big Shot" effect like Spirit Bomb/Kamehameha from Dragon Ball Z

I chose to limit them with fungible resource points. This accomplishes nicely the first goal of incentivizing the choice of "weaker" abilities by allowing them to be used more frequently. This ties in nicely with the 4th goal, in that a player can choose an incredibly powerful ability at level 1, but they may only be able to use that ability after hoarding points for a significant amount of time and spending them all in one go for their huge ability. Additionally, it encourages players to use their weaker abilities in creative ways because they may only spend 1 ability point, rather than solving it trivially for 3 ability points with a stronger ability.

Other ways abilities can be limited that were considered are:
- Locking abilities behind progression requirements (Must be this tall/X level to ride)
- Introducing a point cost to acquiring abilities
- Having a "number of uses" per-ability rather than a shared resource pool.

I wanted the system to remain simple, so I didn't want to choose more than one resource system for abilities. Progression requirements I think unnecessarily limit player freedom during character creation. The point cost to acquire abilities doesn't allow players to make interesting choices during gameplay, only during character creation, and also a player that chooses to pick one big ability rather than 3 small abilities will likely feel less engaged when their one big ability is not relevant to the current situation; having multiple smaller abilities gives players more options to consider and makes it more likely they can find a creative solution to an obstacle with their available tools. I like the shared resource pool because it allows us to use ability points as a reward for Styles; additionally, I think the tradeoff of spending X points on one ability versus Y points on another for a given situation is better than "I should save my uses of Ability Z for hypothetical situation A".

Talents
-----
Originally, talents and abilities were the same system. Abilities could be active or passive. I didn't like this because characters could often end up with either lots of active abilities, or lots of passive abilities, both of which restrict the player's ability to engage with certain situations. Having access to both active and passive abilities I think allows for engagement with a wider variety of situations and encourages different types of problem solving.

A few additional problems with the unified system were:
- The "minmax" choice was often a single active and the rest are passives. (Because getting two active abilities comes with an opportunity cost; each ability point must be spent on one ability or the other, so having two abilities increases versatility, but not necessarily power. Passive abilities do not have this tradeoff.) This led to boring characters that are powerful "one-trick ponies".
- No way to balance passives against each other. They all cost zero ability points. So why would you ever pick, say, *Levitate* over straight *Flight*? Other than for flavor/lore reasons for non-minmaxing players.

So instead, passives were split out as Talents, which have a cost to acquire. You can still pick up *Flight* over *Levitate*, but it means your character won't be able to spend points on other passive skills. I am okay with the downside of picking one powerful passive over multiple weaker passives because "powerful" passive abilities tend to just mean that they are more versatile. That means that often, you're not losing out on the versatility of your character when you spend lots of points on a single talent.


Style
-----
Styles accomplish a few goals.

One goal is to incentivize flavorful play. The player must take actions that are relevant to the core of their character in order to earn their usage of abilities. A "Barbarian Rage" character will always be looking for an excuse to enter a fight or become angry to earn their ability points, while a rogue will always be sneaking around and attempting to lie, cheat, and steal to earn their ability points.

The second goal is to prevent characters from feeling too similar. Flavor is still very important. For example, a large warrior-type character might have a "Crush" ability that smashes things to dust, while the same ability could be represented on a rogue-type character with a "Sabotage" ability, or on a mage-type character with a "Deconstruct" or "Make Vanish" ability. The same mechanical abilities being available for characters of multiple types can cause them to feel indistinct. The "Style" mechanic helps characters feel different, even with the same abilities, because they earn their usage in different ways. A barbarian who earns ability points through becoming angry feels like they're smashing through barriers in a fury, as opposed to the mage that researches hard and is able to destroy an obstacle because they are now intimately familiar with its composition and the necessary magic.

Creating a New Character and Leveling Up
-----
I have not though about this very much yet. This section is essentially placeholder text.

I'd like progression to accomplish a few things.
- Most obviously, allow for a feeling of progress. People should always leave a session excited to come back and play with their character not only because of the story, but also because they have a new ability or talent to try out.
- I'd like this to be low cognitive-load for the GM. Many progression systems involve calculating encounter EXP, deciding on rewards for quests, making sure those rewards are roughly equally distributed, etc. I want GMs to be able to use rewards to enhance their campaign, but not cause extra homework for them when prepping for sessions.
- I'd like progression to be tied to specific actions. It's easy to say "you gain a level every X sessions" or something, but players won't feel like they've earned anything. They know that whether they kill the lich or not, they'll get more powerful, so they don't necessarily have as much of a stake in the outcome of an adventure.
- I'd like progression to be reflected in the character's story development as well; a character that improves their Ranged Offense might be trained by a legendary marksman as an off-screen event between sessions.

Something I'm currently not sure how to balance is the desire for consequences in-game to have real psychological effects on the players in terms of the rewards they receive. If the players are always doing pro-bono work in the most selfless manner possible, should there be a real cost to the players in terms of progression/character power? If there isn't a cost, the decision to self-sacrifice is an easier one to make. I'm leaning toward the line of thinking that this is a non-issue for two reasons:

1) Tabletop RPG players are dicks, I've seen them burn children alive to save themselves.
2) Part of playing a tabletop game is being able to take on whichever role you want. Should it be harder to play a self-sacrificing Paladin than a selfish, scheming Warlock? Probably not; I don't want to design a game that shames its players for not living up their characters' ideals.


So with these in mind, here are my current lines of thinking about progression.
One way to do progression is similar to Cypher System/Numenera, where there are few levels, but each level has sublevels associated with it. Rather than waiting a long time to get a single level, which then gives you attribute, skill, talent, and ability bonuses, instead, each of those bonuses is split between 4 or more sublevels that you can take in any order. At the end of each session (or adventure, or some other metric), a character improves their sublevel and chooses a bonus to apply to their character. They cannot choose the same bonus twice until they level up. Once they've obtained each choice, their character's level improves as a more direct indicator of their power.

Another way is just to have amorphous progression. Perhaps sometimes players find artifacts of great power, and rather than giving them specific items that have particular abilities; they instead each get a talent point or ability point or skill increase. This might be challenging to do in a setting-agnostic way. Additionally, it may be difficult to set appropriate pacing for the accumulation of different types of rewards, or in fact even *decrease* immersion because yeah, the party found a talent point artifact last time, and this new artifact gives ability points, which is obviously a result of the GM favoring balanced characters and not a reflection of the artifact itself in terms of its in-game characteristics.

Tasks
=====

Attempting a Task
-----
Tasks can only be performed once per party to counteract the numbers effect. Playing the game with a party of two should feel similar to playing with a party of six. If an attempt can be made per character, even if only one character has skills relevant to a particular task, because of the variance of die rolls, more attempts increases the chance of success. In this way, a party of six will often succeed where a party of two would not, even if the party of two has characters with more relevant skills.

Combat
=====

General
-----
These combat rules exist essentially to solve the time commitment problem with combat. Yes, combat is fun for many players, but it consumes a disproportionate amount of time in many systems. A few seconds of "in-character" time brawling might play out over several hours around a gaming table. To me, tabletop RPGs are about creating interesting stories. While combat can generate great narratives, and often great events that people will recount weeks later when talking to other tabletop RPG players, it just takes too long to do so. My favorite stories are from interactions between player characters and each other, or between player characters and memorable NPCs. Combat often detracts from that in that you make less of those moments per session if most of each session is devoted to swinging swords at each other.

Devoting so many rules and systems just to account for combat causes combat to become the primary method for players to overcome any obstacle. It is difficult to then make peaceful characters, such as a traveling pacifist priest who is scared by the sight of blood, or a hearty merchant who has wealth to spare but hasn't had a reason to sprint in many years. Playing an athletic, skilled adventurer appeals to many people, but having skill in combat is mandated in many rulesets in a way that other skills are not, causing it to be unenjoyable to create characters that cannot or will not fight. If you make a non-combat character in D&D, you'd be left out during those 4-hour combat sessions.

I understand that there is great appeal in detailed combat systems for many players. I argue that there are a great many systems to choose from if that is why you play tabletop RPGs, and that there will never be a reason to choose this one over a battle-tested system like D&D 5e or Pathfinder.

The one-hit mechanic does a few things. Primarily, it serves to speed up combat, which I see as a desirable goal for the reasons listed above. It also serves to make combat feel more deadly. It only takes one unlucky roll to take a player character out of combat. This should help to make combat feel exciting and dangerous, despite the lack of strong systems to support combat. The last thing I've considered is to make the element of surprise and preparedness feel meaningful. In many systems, getting the jump on your opponent is certainly helpful, but especially in longer fights, an overall minor advantage. The element of surprise is often the single most important thing you can have to ensure victory in combat in the real world (not that I have much personal experience, or that I'm an expert), and it is a nice minor touch to have this system reflect that reality. If everything is defeated in a single hit, it often only takes one round of combat to finish off your opponents. This makes a free first turn incredibly important.

Creating unique combat encounters in this system is certainly more difficult due to the limited tools available to GMs, but still possible. Hardy, defensive monsters will have a higher target difficulty to hit, rather than a higher health pool. Especially lethal or dangerous monsters will have a higher target difficulty for remaining standing after an attempted attack. Some opponents might not be particularly hardy or dangerous, but they might have a very high initiative score, and often get the entire first round of combat to themself.

Attacking and Defending
-----
As far as attacking and defending go, they put the power into players' hands. Players feel like they have control over their own destiny. If they get hit, it's because they rolled poorly, if they defeat an enemy, it's because they rolled well. It's often frustrating to "play well" tactically in D&D only to be downed because of a lucky crit from a nonthreatening enemy. This can still happen, but the frustration is lessened because rolling poorly feels less like it's out of the control of the player. This is essentially an aspect of combat I've ripped from Cypher System because I quite enjoyed it there.

Death and Failure
=====
In the original rules, characters fell just like enemy creatures did. This was kind of un-fun because you could be knocked out very quickly with a single bad roll, and you'd be unengaged with the rest of the combat because there was no action you could take to improve the situation. Adding an *injured* state keeps players attentive for when their turn comes up and at least somewhat engaged with combat after getting hit.

Items and Equipment
=====

Inventory
-----
The primary motivation for these inventory systems is to cut down on mental clutter. Often players will forget what their characters have access to in their inventories because it's a poorly maintained scribbled list many lines long on their character sheets. Picking up a plot-important key might be forgotten in the next session because its presence is buried within many lines of text that players seldom read. The idea of these systems is that if something is listed as being in your inventory, it's because it's important. Either important to your character and the fantasy that character represents, or important to the narrative or mechanics of the game. A quick glance should be all a player needs to determine what tools they have at their disposal. The points and rolls systems exist to allow players to utilize creative solutions with mundane items despite the lack of useful items listed on their character sheets.

Future Systems
=====

Roleplaying
-----
I'm thinking about adding systems that help systematize aspects of a character's personality and traits. So many players only half-create their characters; some add pictures but no backstory, some add personality traits but no physical description, etc. Not that every character must have their own dedicated novel and fan-art community, but I'd like to add more systems (like Styles) that encourage traditionally minmax combat-focused players to put more though into their characters.

Options include:
- Negative personality/physical quirks that offer bonuses during character creation
- Tying backstories to talents/abilities (Maybe requiring a one-sentence description of how/why your character has that talent/ability)
- Just enforcing one or two things, like Cypher System's party relationships, or Dungeon World's "one reason Your character is unique"

Setting/Campaign Management
-----
I'd like to have some sort of light framework for how stories should progress. Say, each session represents an adventure the party goes on, but between sessions roughly 6 months/1 year passes. This helps establish the ruleset as ideal for less-committed parties that have inconsistent attendance, but I'm not sure that's behavior that should be encouraged (because as a GM, I really feel like it disrespects the amount of time we put into creating sessions for our players), and additionally it's difficult to create a framework that works well for all campaigns in all settings.

However, I'd like there to be some sort of light methodology to improvising a campaign session for GMs that prefer to be preparation-light. The ideal state to get to would be one where a GM can feel comfortable just showing up with nothing more than a few ideas and running a session entirely on-the-fly. Dungeon World had some really good ideas about how to systematically think about a campaign, but those systems don't work for every GM, and they can easily feel to restrictive in terms of a GM's ability to direct the story in ways they think will be most interesting.

Artifacts
-----
Right now "Interesting Items" are just a small aside in the rules text, but I'd like to flesh them out into something easily given on-the-fly as a quest reward in the middle of a campaign, but that remains interesting. I don't, however, want to spend lots of GM time preparing these kinds of items or distribute them equally among the party. I also want to make sure GMs can feel comfortable rewarding powerful, interesting items, knowing that they won't unintentionally break the game.

Ideas include:
- Items that are just selected from the "Abilities" list. (Could also develop a system for items that grant talents as well.)
- Items have a limited amount of uses based on how powerful it is, similar to cyphers from Cypher System. This is good because no matter how powerful an item, it will only break the game until the item itself is broken/used up.
