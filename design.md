Quick Six
=====
A rules-light tabletop RPG designed to be described in under a page, and incredibly easy to expand upon.

Based on Open Six/Mini Six ruleset

This document is meant to be used in conjunction with the rules document. This is the design document, which details some of the thoughts that went into decisions around Quick Six's systems and rules.

Characters
=====

Attributes
-----
I essentially started with the D&D model, and eliminated Wisdom, because often it can be difficult to distinguish a clear line between Wisdom and Intelligence. Really? Seeing things (perception) is a "Wisdom" skill? Additionally, Constitution is gone because it too often relates to physical strength. In an abstract, somewhat metaphorical sense, there is "strength" in withstanding a wound or shrugging off the effects of a poison in the same way that there is "strength" in bending iron. Both stats lend themselves to the same core experience of playing a character who is heroic in the manner of Beowulf and Hercules insofar as they are unrealistically athletic. If you want to play this type of character, you can prioritize the *Strength* attribute, instead of being forced to choose between *Strength* and *Constitution*. This choice is not present for mage-type characters (*Intelligence*), rogue-type characters (*Dexterity*), and Bard-type characters (*Charisma*), so it should be the same for beefy bruiser-type characters.

Skills
-----
This type of framework is used in many systems, and the primary reason I've chosen it here is so that we make no assumptions about the setting in which this ruleset will be used. In a cyberpunk world, *Hacking* would likely be one of the most important skills one can have, but it's clearly not appropriate for a medieval fantasy setting. Attempting to genericize these skills into something like *Bypassing Security* which represents lockpicking and hacking together, depending on the setting, is just awkward and will likely still fail to adequately represent the skills important to many settings.

Abilities
-----
Abilities are amorphous in the way they are in order to provide a framework that can accommodate spells, feats, skills, attacks, actions, and all manner of other entities from other game systems. Feats from D&D will often have conditions, but no difficulty or cost. For example, Darkvision could become "When it is dark, gain 2 dice in the *sight* skill". Spells from D&D might have a cost, but no difficulty or conditions. For example, casting Cure Wounds might become an ability with a cost of 1 ability point, causing the character to manage their usages much as they would as a spellcaster class in D&D.

Much of the interesting parts of a character will probably come from the abilities they have access to. This is often true for many players, and this system aims to solve a few problems present in D&D (and similar rulesets). One problem is that often spellcaster characters can just do more things than other characters can. They have a ton of tools at their disposal. If their charisma is garbage, they might have the "Charm" spell available. If their Strength score is low, they can just cast "Enlarge Person". Spellcaster characters are interesting to play, and that experience should be available to players, but it shouldn't come at the cost of trivializing their party members' contributions. With this ability system, the aim is that every player has access to the same number of "spells" (abilities), the abilities are just flavored according the character's background to maintain the fantasy of playing a character with particular strengths. Secondly, this system is an attempt to solve the "linear fighter, exponential mage" problem, where a Fighter character gets access to maybe 2, 3, 4 attacks in a single round as they become higher level, while a mage gets access to 9th level spells such as *Wish*, *Time Stop*, *Power Word Kill*, that outclass anything a Fighter will ever be able to accomplish. Often a fighter will start being able to use abilities with extra reach, say, one extra unit, but casters can access *Meteor Swarm* with a range of 1 mile. This system cannot completely limit this, as the fantasy experience for mages demands that they have abilities that break the laws of physics, while the fantasy experience for Fighters often just involves being unrealistically athletic and skilled in combat. However, I want to avoid codifying a specific "spellcasting" system into the game that lends itself to abuse in terms of the diversity and quantity of tools available to characters able to cast spells when compared to characters without the ability to cast spells.

Style
-----
Style was added for a few reasons.

One is to allow characters ability points. Without ability points, it can often be difficult to find an appropriate cost for a powerful ability. Many players want the ability to give their character say, a teleport spell. It forces the player to recognize an opportunity cost. They might be able to use one powerful ability to overcome a difficult obstacle, but they might also see that they could use less powerful abilities in more creative ways several times instead. By using the powerful ability, they give up some usage of their lesser abilities. Without ability points, it's very difficult to give a meaningful cost to the ability that would prevent players from just warping around everywhere and trivializing many obstacles. It's important for players to have powerful tools at their disposal every so often, however, because it varies the pace of the game.

The second reason is to prevent characters from feeling too similar. Flavor is still very important. For example, a large warrior-type character might have a "Crush" ability that smashes things to dust, while the same ability could be represented on a rogue-type character with a "Sabotage" ability, or on a mage-type character with a "Deconstruct" or "Make Vanish" ability. The same mechanical abilities being available for characters of multiple types can cause them to feel indistinct. The "Style" mechanic helps characters feel different, even with the same abilities, because they earn their usage in different ways.

Another reason is to incentivize flavorful play. The player must take actions that are relevant to the core of their character in order to earn their usage of abilities. A "Barbarian Rage" character will always be looking for an excuse to enter a fight or become angry to earn their ability points, while a rogue will always be sneaking around and attempting to lie, cheat, and steal to earn theirs.

Creating a New Character and Leveling Up
-----
I have not though about this very much yet. The above section is essentially placeholder text.

Tasks
=====

Attempting a Task
-----
Tasks can only be performed once per party to counteract the numbers effect. Playing the game with a party of two should feel similar to playing with a party of six. If an attempt can be made per character, even if only one character has skills relevant to a particular task, because of the variance of die rolls, more attempts increases the chance of success. In this way, a party of six will often succeed where a party of two would not, even if the party of two has characters with more relevant skills.

Combat
=====

General
-----
These combat rules exist essentially to solve the time commitment problem with combat. Yes, combat is fun for many players, but it consumes a disproportionate amount of time in many systems. A few seconds of "in-character" time brawling might play out over several hours around a gaming table. To me, tabletop RPGs are about creating interesting stories. While combat can generate great narratives, and often great events that people will recount weeks later when talking to other tabletop RPG players, it just takes too long to do so. My favorite stories are from interactions between player characters and each other, or between player characters and memorable NPCs. Combat often detracts from that in that you make less of those moments per session if most of each session is devoted to swinging swords at each other.

Devoting so many rules and systems just to account for combat causes combat to become the primary method for players to overcome any obstacle. It is difficult to then make peaceful characters, such as a traveling pacifist priest who is scared by the sight of blood, or a hearty merchant who has wealth to spare but hasn't had a reason to sprint in many years. Playing an athletic, skilled adventurer appeals to many people, but having skill in combat is mandated in many rulesets in a way that other skills are not, causing it to be unenjoyable to create characters that cannot or will not fight. If you make a non-combat character in D&D, you'd be left out during those 4-hour combat sessions.

I understand that there is great appeal in detailed combat systems for many players. I argue that there are a great many systems to choose from if that is why you play tabletop RPGs, and that there will never be a reason to choose this one over a battle-tested system like D&D 5e or Pathfinder.

The one-hit mechanic does a few things. Primarily, it serves to speed up combat, which I see as a desirable goal for the reasons listed above. It also serves to make combat feel more deadly. It only takes one unlucky roll to take a player character out of combat. This should help to make combat feel exciting and dangerous, despite the lack of strong systems to support combat. The last thing I've considered is to make the element of surprise and preparedness feel meaningful. In many systems, getting the jump on your opponent is certainly helpful, but especially in longer fights, an overall minor advantage. The element of surprise is often the single most important thing you can have to ensure victory in combat in the real world (not that I have much personal experience, or that I'm an expert), and it is a nice minor touch to have this system reflect that reality. If everything is defeated in a single hit, it often only takes one round of combat to finish off your opponents. This makes a free first turn incredibly important.

Creating unique combat encounters in this system is certainly more difficult due to the limited tools available to GMs, but still possible. Hardy, defensive monsters will have a higher target difficulty to hit, rather than a higher health pool. Especially lethal or dangerous monsters will have a higher target difficulty for remaining standing after an attempted attack. Some opponents might not be particularly hardy or dangerous, but they might have a very high initiative score, and often get the entire first round of combat to themself.

Attacking and Defending
-----
As far as attacking and defending go, they put the power into players' hands. Players feel like they have control over their own destiny. If they get hit, it's because they rolled poorly, if they defeat an enemy, it's because they rolled well. It's often frustrating to "play well" tactically in D&D only to be downed because of a lucky crit from a nonthreatening enemy. This can still happen, but the frustration is lessened because rolling poorly feels less like it's out of the control of the player. This is essentially an aspect of combat I've ripped from Cypher System because I quite enjoyed it there.

Death and Failure

Items and Equipment

Inventory
-----
The primary motivation for these inventory systems is to cut down on mental clutter. Often players will forget what their characters have access to in their inventories because it's a poorly maintained scribbled list many lines long on their character sheets. Picking up a plot-important key might be forgotten in the next session because its presence is buried within many lines of text that players seldom read. The idea of these systems is that if something is listed as being in your inventory, it's because it's important. Either important to your character and the fantasy that character represents, or important to the narrative or mechanics of the game. A quick glance should be all a player needs to determine what tools they have at their disposal. The points and rolls systems exist to allow players to utilize creative solutions with mundane items despite the lack of useful items listed on their character sheets.
