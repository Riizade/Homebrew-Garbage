# Homebrew Garbage
The ruleset for my custom tabletop RPG system, tentatively called "Homebrew Garbage".

This repository is organized as a set of Markdown files. The main piece of content is rules.md, which contains the specifics of how to run and play a campaign in the Homebrew Garbage ruleset.

Most of the other Markdown files serve as appendices to the rules for creating characters and running the game.
